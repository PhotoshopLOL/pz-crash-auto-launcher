# Disclaimer

I am **not** responsible for anything caused by the misuse of this script. Excluding the appropriate areas, do not attempt to modify it.

**Compatible with any game build.**




# Introduction

This simple script will detect if ```Project Zomboid``` is running and if its not, it will launch the game.

In a number of ways this could be useful, but most notably it could be used for debugging purposes when creating content.

e.g., the game crashes: it will be restarted automatically.

# Limitations

Unfortunately without modification- this script only supports the Steam version currently. It would not be difficult to add support for other verisons of the game. Feel free to create these on your own accord.

This script only works if Steam is currently installed on your system. It requires Steam because the code is essentially launching a shortcut of the Project Zomboid process.

# Installation

**1.** Download the ```Project Zomboid - Crash Auto Launcher.bat``` by clicking ```Code``` and ```Download ZIP```.

**2.** Extract the ```Project Zomboid - Crash Auto Launcher.bat``` anywhere on your system.

**3.** Run the script. Enjoy.


# FAQ

### How can I change how *often* the script scans for the ProjectZomboid64 process?

```timeout /t 10``` 

Modify this value according to preference. Unit = seconds.
